## Project Proposal

This project aims to develop a Shiny website application that integrates with the anime Data API to analyze trend covid cases/deaths overtime. Interactive visualizations and time series analysis will be implemented. The application will provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, researchers, and the general public, enabling them to better understand the progression of the pandemic and prepare more effectively for future global health crises. By analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and comparing the impact across different regions, the application will support data-driven decision-making and improve readiness for potential outbreaks.

## Data

Through the Yelp Fusion Market API, we can obtain the most updated data from the website, ensuring our application provides accurate and real-time information for all audiences.

## Key Dimensions

-   Cases - number of covid cases each day, cumulative

-   Deaths - number of people died because of positive covid test

## Research Question

The project will also answer the questions below

1.  How have COVID-19 cases and deaths evolved over time in different countries and states?

2.  Are there seasonal patterns or periodic spikes in COVID-19 cases and deaths?

3.  Which countries or states had the highest and lowest death rates relative to their population over time?

4.  What are the early warning indicators that signal a potential surge in COVID-19 cases?

5.  How do COVID-19 trends compare between high-income and low-income countries? (if income api is found)

6.  Did government interventions (e.g., lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccination rollouts) correlate with changes in COVID-19 cases and deaths?

7.  What lessons can be learned from COVID-19 data to improve preparedness for future global pandemics?

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

-   Data will be scraped from the web API using SQL.

### Time Analysis

-   Research needed
-   
-   

### Visualization

-   Case/death trends will be analyzed through different data visualizations.
-   Visualizations of attribute summaries will be created using box plots, bar charts, and histograms.
-   Visualizations will be created using ggplot2
-   More to add

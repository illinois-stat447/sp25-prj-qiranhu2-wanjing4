# Data Analysis of Anime Data

### Load libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

### Pattern Discovering

Try some basic function to see if any pattern exists

```{r}
da_set <- anime_data2
summary(da_set)
cor(da_set[sapply(da_set, is.numeric)])
```

Do one hot on type, to see any relation between score, type, and rating

#### Overall score and Outlier

From the block below, we see that top 25% of the score are above 7.

```{r}
anime_score <- anime_data0[!is.na(anime_data0$score),]$score
boxplot(anime_score,
        horizontal = TRUE,
        main = "Anime Scores",
        ylab = "Score",
        col = "lightblue",
        border = "darkblue")
boxplot(anime_score,
        horizontal = TRUE,
        outline = FALSE,
        main = "Anime Scores without Outliers",
        ylab = "Score",
        col = "lightblue",
        border = "darkblue")
summary(anime_score)

```

##### Count outliers

```{r}
Q1 <- quantile(anime_score, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(anime_score, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR_val <- Q3 - Q1

# Define lower and upper bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_val
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_val

# Count outliers
num_outliers <- sum(anime_score < lower_bound | anime_score > upper_bound, na.rm = TRUE)

num_outliers

```

#### Top 10 genres

Use the dataset "anime_data2" to find top 10 genre criteria of top 10 genre: average score

```{r}
```

```{r}
genre_counts <- anime_data2 |>
  select(genres) |>
  mutate(genres = str_split(genres, ",\\s*")) |>  # split genres on comma
  unnest(genres) |>
  group_by(genres) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
genre_counts
```

find top genre using avg score Based on the result, anime who has win the award has the higest avg score

```{r}
top_genres <- anime_data5 |>
  select(score, genres) |>
  filter(!is.na(score), !is.na(genres)) |>
  mutate(genres = str_split(genres, ",\\s*")) |>
  unnest(genres) |>
  group_by(genres) |>
  summarise(
    avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_score)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)
top_genres
```

##### Result: top 10 genres are "Award, Winning", "Suspense", "Mystery", "Drama", "Romance", "Supernatural", "Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Girls Love"

```{r}
top10_genre <- c("Award, Winning", "Suspense", "Mystery", "Drama", "Romance", 
                 "Supernatural", "Action", "Adventure", "Sports", "Girls Love")
```

#### Top studio and producers

##### Studios

count the studios

```{r}
studio_counts <- anime_data5 |>
  select(studios, score) |>
  unnest(studios) |>
  filter(!is.na(score)) |>
  group_by(studios) |>
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count))
studio_counts
```

```{r}
top_studio <- anime_data5 |>
  select(score, studios) |>
  filter(!is.na(score), !is.na(studios)) |>
  unnest(studios) |>
  group_by(studios) |>
  summarise(
    avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_score = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    count = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_score))
top_studio
```

For each count, analysis using boxplot on the distribution of anime produced in studios.

```{r}
studios_counts <- as.numeric(table(unlist(anime_data5$studios)))

log_counts <- log1p(studios_counts)  # log(1 + x) to handle zeros
hist(log_counts,
     breaks = 20,
     main = "Log-Transformed Distribution of Anime Counts per Studio",
     xlab = "log(1 + Anime Count)",
     col = "skyblue")
```

It is hard to see which studio are really popular because give the count of of 1,2, or 3 doesn't give us too much information on their performance in a long run - data is insufficient. Based on domain knowledge, it seems a larger anime count for the studio corresponds to a higher score and are more well-known.

After analysis, it seems that the column "studios" should be re processed for a better and easier training process in prediction part.

Please see data preprocessing.Rmd "Studios Data Processing" for detail.

##### Producers

top producers are seleted if their anime counts are \>= 30 and have average score \>= 7.03

```{r}
anime_data6
boxplot(score ~ studio_rank,
        data = anime_data6,
        main = "Score Distribution: Top vs Other Producers",
        xlab = "Producer Rank",
        ylab = "Anime Score",
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))
summary(anime_data6)
```

### Type and Rating Analysis

```{r}
anime_data6$type
table(anime_data6$type)
boxplot(score ~ type,
        data = anime_data6,
        main = "Distribution of Anime Scores by Type",
        xlab = "Anime Type",
        ylab = "Score",
        col = "lightblue",
        las = 2)  # rotate x-axis labels for readability
anime_data6 |>
  group_by(type) |>
  summarise(avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(desc(avg_score))
```

#### Check difference between the types

Because p value \< 0.05, there is significant difference in average score between some types

```{r}
anova_result <- aov(score ~ type, data = anime_data6)
summary(anova_result)

```

By implementing Tukey test, it shows which two types have average score that are significantly different.

```{r}
TukeyHSD(anova_result)

```

From the result, we see that Movie and TV had a significantly higher average score than others. TV Special, Special, and ONA had lower average scores but also significantly different from other types. PV is not significantly different from CM, OVA, or Music in many comparisons. And TV Special overlaps with several types.

*Based on the result, we add a new categorical column for predictive analysis. Detail is in Data preprocessing Rmd*

#### Rating Analysis

```{r}
anime_data7$type
table(anime_data7$rating)
boxplot(score ~ rating,
        data = anime_data7,
        main = "Distribution of Anime Scores by Rating",
        xlab = "Anime Rating",
        ylab = "Score",
        col = "lightblue",
        las = 1,
        cex.axis = 0.6)  # rotate x-axis labels for readability
anime_data7 |>
  group_by(rating) |>
  summarise(avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(desc(avg_score))
```

#### Check difference between the ratings

Because p value \< 0.05, there is significant difference in average score between some ratings

```{r}
anova_result_rating <- aov(score ~ rating, data = anime_data7)
summary(anova_result_rating)

```

By implementing Tukey test, it shows which two ratings have average score that are significantly different.

```{r}
TukeyHSD(anova_result_rating)

```

From the report, all other pairs have significantly differenct average score from each other except for PG - Children-G - All Ages and R+ - Mild Nudity-G - All Ages pairs. Based on the result and the boxplot above, the new column for rating was created in Data preprocessing Rmd.

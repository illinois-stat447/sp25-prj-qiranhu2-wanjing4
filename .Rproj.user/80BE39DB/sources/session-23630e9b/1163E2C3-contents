# Team Contributions

The team consisted of two members, Qiran and Zoey, who combined expertise in interactive application development, data analysis, and project management. Through regular discussions and coordinated planning, the team ensured that the platform’s features for anime content discovery and its analytical tools for industry stakeholders were developed in a timely manner. Each member took on distinct roles to address the project’s technical challenges and research objectives.

## Qiran

Qiran served as the lead developer for the project, who is responsible for the construction of the interactive platform using the R Shiny framework. He built the various features in the Shiny application and implemented several key functions that enhance anime content discovery for fans. This included developing the user interface and interactive components so that users could seamlessly explore the anime dataset through dynamic visualizations and responsive design. During development, Qiran also performed data integration tasks and proactively identified potential issues in the dataset, such as inconsistencies or missing values. He reported these data quality problems to the team, which informed the data preprocessing strategy and ensured the reliability of subsequent analyses. In addition to his development work, Qiran also contributed ideas and feedback that shaped the project’s direction in order to better align the technical implementation with the research goals.

Beyond software development, Qiran made extensive contributions to the project’s written documentation and presentation. He authored significant portions of the research report such as the introduction, abstract, motivation, research questions, setup, methodology, data visualization, conclusion, and future work sections. Hence, he provided a comprehensive narrative of the project’s purpose, design, and findings, framing the context of current obstacles in the anime market and how the team’s platform addresses them. Qiran’s writing ensured that the report was coherent and covered all aspects of the work from exploring different obstacles to proposed useful solutions. Furthermore, Qiran took on a leadership role during the final presentation of the project. He presented the project’s motivation and gave a live demonstration of the application’s features, which highlights how the platform enables fans to discover anime content more effectively. His part of the presentation showcased the practical utility of the developed features and how they resolve challenges in the anime market. Additionally, Qiran acted as the team’s time manager throughout the project. He kept the group on schedule by setting internal deadlines and monitoring progress, ensuring that development milestones and deliverables were met in a timely manner. This project coordination role was crucial in keeping the team focused and on track.

## Zoey

Zoey established the basic structure and ideas for the platform and research, which converts the project’s goals into a concrete plan. This planning included creating the initial README and documentation that outlined project objectives, defining the feature set for the application, and designing the approach for data preprocessing and predictive analysis. Zoey led the data acquisition and preparation phase by conducting a thorough evaluation of available datasets related to the anime industry. She compared and rigorously tested five potential anime datasets, assessing each for quality, completeness, and relevance to the research questions. Based on this analysis, Zoey selected the most suitable dataset for the project, providing a solid foundation for both the application and the analytical tasks. She then performed data preprocessing on the chosen dataset, cleaning and organizing the data to be ready for analysis and integration into the Shiny app. Zoey also contributed to the application development by implementing the app’s basic filtering feature, which allows users to filter anime content by various attributes. This filtering functionality became a core part of the user interface, and Zoey worked closely with Qiran to integrate it seamlessly into the broader Shiny application. Her work ensured that the platform could handle user queries efficiently, thereby directly enhancing the user experience for fans exploring the anime catalog.

In addition to her contributions to data preparation and interface features, Zoey drove the project’s analytical and predictive modeling efforts, addressing the needs of industry stakeholders for insights. She proposed and tested multiple solutions to technical problems encountered during analysis by employing statistical methods to overcome challenges such as predicting anime popularity trends or user engagement metrics. Through an iterative process of applying and evaluating different statistical models, Zoey identified robust analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. She then authored the data analysis section of the research report, where she documented the analytical methodology, the models used, and the key findings. This section detailed how the data was explored and what predictive insights were gained regarding the anime market, such as trends or factors influencing anime success. Zoey’s writing provided critical analysis that complemented the application’s development, which demonstrates how the platform’s data could be translated into actionable knowledge for industry stakeholders. During the final presentation, Zoey presented the data analysis results and predictive insights. She explained to the audience how these insights could inform decision-making in the anime industry, which shows the strategic ideas of the project beyond the current challeneges. Additionally, Zoey took charge of the team’s project management through organizational tools. She created and maintained a detailed project workspace on Notion, which served as a central hub for tracking tasks, milestones, and resources. This allowed the team to coordinate effectively, monitor progress, and adjust plans in an agile manner. Zoey’s management of the project timeline and documentation on Notion ensured transparency in teamwork and helped synchronize the collaborative efforts.

## Collaborative Efforts 

Throughout the project, Qiran and Zoey meet regularly to discuss progress, troubleshoot issues, and improve the application development. This collaboration ensures that the platform effectively helps anime fans through a well designed user interface while simultaneously generating valuable insights for industry stakeholders through rigorous data analysis. As one can see, the team’s coordinated efforts led to a comprehensive solution addressing the identified obstacles.
